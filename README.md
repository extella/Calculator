# Calculator
A simple calculator made with Java.

# Limitations
Basic calculations are entered into the calculator in exactly the same order as they are written on paper. Although, the program is only limited to two numbers. The operations the program can handle are only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

# How to run
The program can be compiled and run on any IDE that has Java support. The user is required to have Java pre-installed on their computer as well. The program can also be turned in to a .JAR file should they want to run it directly, but that is beyond this documentation.

# How to use
A user is expected to input two numbers to get values from by either adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing them while following the rules of their respective operations.

The flow is as follows:
1. User inputs in the first field.
2. User inputs in the second field.
3. User chooses which operation to use by clicking on its respective operand ("+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, "*" for multiplication, and "/" for division).
4. User is shown calculated value. 

# Error handling
Should the user forget to input in a field, an error message will be shown. Should the inputted digits have any problems with the rules of a certain operation, the user will be shown an appropriate error message as well.
